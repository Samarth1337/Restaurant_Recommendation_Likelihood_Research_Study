# restaurant_recommendation_likelihood_study

This research project focuses on understanding the factors influencing participants' likelihood to recommend their favorite restaurants to others. The project employs experimental design, including between-subject and within-subject testing, to investigate the effects of offering discounts and opening new locations on restaurant suggestions. Statistical analyses, including 2-way ANOVA tests, reveal significant main effects of time but not of scenarios, with limited power affecting the ability to detect small effects. The study emphasizes the importance of interpreting findings cautiously and acknowledges limitations in sample representativeness and scenario complexity. Further exploration is suggested to understand the nuanced interactions between scenario conditions and participant responses.


## Overview:
This project focuses on understanding the factors influencing participants' likelihood to recommend their favorite restaurants. We utilize experimental design, including between-subject and within-subject testing, to investigate the effects of offering discounts and opening new locations on restaurant suggestions.

## Key Features:

Experimental design: We employ both between-subject and within-subject testing to study the impacts of different scenarios.
Statistical analyses: We utilize 2-way ANOVA tests to analyze the data, revealing significant main effects of time but not of scenarios.
Limited power: Our study acknowledges limitations in detecting small effects due to limited statistical power.
Importance of interpretation: We emphasize the importance of interpreting findings cautiously, considering sample limitations and scenario complexity.

## Results:

The statistical analyses revealed a significant main effect of time on restaurant recommendations (F(1, 65) = 67.139, p < .001).
However, there were no significant effects observed for the scenarios of offering discounts or opening new locations (F(1, 65) = 0.651, p = .423).
Limited power affected the ability to detect small effects, particularly in the scenario conditions, with a power of .1547.

## Conclusions:

Temporal factors significantly influence restaurant recommendations, indicating potential shifts in preferences over time.
Scenario conditions, such as discounts or new locations, did not significantly impact participants' likelihood to recommend restaurants.
Findings underscore the importance of cautious interpretation due to limitations in sample representativeness and scenario complexity.
Further exploration is recommended to understand the nuanced interactions between scenario conditions and participant responses, potentially revealing subtler effects.

## Next Steps:
Further exploration is suggested to understand the nuanced interactions between scenario conditions and participant responses, potentially uncovering subtler effects that may have been obscured in the overall analysis.
