# restaurant_recommendation_likelihood_study

This research project focuses on understanding the factors influencing participants' likelihood to recommend their favorite restaurants to others. The project employs experimental design, including between-subject and within-subject testing, to investigate the effects of offering discounts and opening new locations on restaurant suggestions. Statistical analyses, including 2-way ANOVA tests, reveal significant main effects of time but not of scenarios, with limited power affecting the ability to detect small effects. The study emphasizes the importance of interpreting findings cautiously and acknowledges limitations in sample representativeness and scenario complexity. Further exploration is suggested to understand the nuanced interactions between scenario conditions and participant responses.
